Michael Macasek's Blog
==================

This is the Jekyll source for Michael Macasek's blog.

It was based off of the awesome Michael Bleigh's blog and website, [Mister Bleigh](http://www.mbleigh.com/), and he gets fullcredit for everything that is good looking or impressive about this site. Elements have also been taken from Scott Chacon's blog, [Scott Chacon](http://schacon.github.com) and Gabriel Horner's blog, [Gabriel Horner](http://tagaholic.me).

It makes some nice use of Jekyll's liquid templating system (see blog.html) and uses Javscript to pull information from GitHub for the open-source section.
