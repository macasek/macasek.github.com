I figured I would finally get my act together and start blogging. I have had many false starts on the blog front previously, I hope this does fall to the same fate. My goal is to post at least once a week.

This time around I going to maintain everything on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master). Most of the layout has been taken from existing GitHub Pages blogs ([Michael Bleigh](http://github.com/mbleigh/mbleigh.github.com/tree/master), [Scott Chacon](http://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com/tree/master), and [Gabriel Horner](http://github.com/cldwalker/cldwalker.github.com/tree/master)) with some additions/improvements here and here. I have only tested this site on FireFox 3.5, Safari 4, and the Developer Preview of Chrome for OSX, so if you are not using one of them let me know if you see any problems. There is one layout issue on FireFox, when the main page is loading the white background is not correctly wrapping the content. Once the page is done loading the layout fixes itself. If anyone knows what is going on I would love to know.

Alright that is enough for now... I have spent most of my afternoon on getting this up and running!
